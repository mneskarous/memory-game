# memory-game

Hello! This is my version of the match game for the Udacity Intro to Programming Final Project. 

The game consists of 16 cards (8 matching pairs) that are randomly shuffled and placed face-down. When the user clicks on a card, it is turned face-up to display a shape. The user must click on another face-down card to turn it over to display another shape. If the second shape matches the first shape, both cards stay face-up. If the second shape does not match the first shape, both cards are flipped back face-down. The user wins once all the pairs have been matched.

Features:
- Star Rating: 3 stars are displayed at the beginning of the game. After 2 minutes elapses from the start of the game, the star rating lowers to 2. Then after another 2 minutes elapses, the star rating is lowered to 1.
- A timer is displayed which counts up from 0 when the game starts. When the user wins, the timer stops.
- The game displays the current number of moves.
- A restart button is present to allow the user to reset the board, star rating, and timer.
- When the user wins, the user is congratulated and the game tells the user what the star rating was, how long it took to win the game, and how many moves were made. The user is asked to play again.

Extras
- CSS animations when cards are unsuccessfully or successfully matched.
